##Scalablity

How many participants can we have in a DIS simulation? Two or three entities is useful for teaching applications, but as soon as we can get a small NVE to work we immediately start to think about just how many we can handle. Scalability can be important for some military applications, though not all. If we're trying to train for call of indirect fire being able to handle only a few participants may be fine. On the other hand a US Army combat brigade may have thousands of vehicles. Can Corps or theater level simulations handle tens or hundreds of thousands of entities? Where is the practical limit?

###Massively Multiplayer Games

There are some analogues to large military simulations in the entertainment world, namely Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft, EVE Online, or No Man's Sky. It's an interesting topic but a bit out of scope for this discussion. In DoD we're effectively restricted to using DoD standards, and strive to _not_ use many clever but non-standard approaches. Interoperability and stability of the code base is often more important to us than sheer performance. Still, MMOG's are clearly the research leader in the domain, and rolling out a new title may cost hundreds of millions of dollars. See the "Further Reading" section for some details.
