##Scalablity

How many participants can we have in a DIS simulation? Two or three entities is useful for teaching applications, but as soon as we can get a small NVE to work we immediately start to think about just how many we can handle. Scalability can be important for some military applications. A US Army combat brigade may have thousands of vehicles. Can Corps or theater level simulations handle tens or hundreds of thousands of entities?

###Massively Multiplayer Games

There are some analogs in the entertainment world, namely massively multiplayer games such as World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and others. It's an interesting topic but a bit out of scope for this discussion. In DoD we're effectively restricted to using DoD standards, and strive to _not_ use many clever but non-standard approaches. Interoperability and stability of the code base is often more important to us than sheer performance. See the "Further Reading" section for some details.
