#The Missing Handbook
## DIS Background

Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), along with High Level Architecture (HLA) and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), is one of the three main standards for exachanging state information in military simulations. Despite its widespread use, much of the background information about DIS is scattered across many documents at many locations, or is known only among practioners on the basis of experice and lore. Those using DIS can read the IEEE standard itself, but the standards documents aims for precision rather than providing a broad and understandable overview. Obtaining the standard from IEEE also costs a modest sum, and getting a purchase order through the bureaucracy is an annoying hurdle for the typical target audience of this handbook. Even the standard itself does not always capture what goes on in deployed applications. Implementors have made pragmatic decisions where the standard is unclear or silent. The folk understanding of standards such as DIS in working applications is notoriously difficult to capture. One has to find the right person with the right knowledge, and he has to be available and willing to answer questions.  There's no centralized place to learn about DIS and how to use it in applications. 

This document is intended to be an open source and community maintained introduction to the theory and practice of DIS. 

Often the people who find they need to learn something about DIS are programmers who are thrown head-first into the problem. They're given some vague instructions, usually summed up as "Hey, we need to implement DIS in our application. Go make it work." Sometimes the programmers don't have experience with simulation or virutal worlds. They're often working on the project for a few weeks before moving on to something else. They're OK with coding, and often with network programming, but using DIS involves hidden assumptions about the problem domain. For example, one would think that it is easy to direct an object in a virtual world to move one meter north. This is tricker than it may seem at first glance. What coordinate system is being used? Are SI or Imperial units being used in that coordinate system? How does one uniquely identify the object to be moved so that it and it alone moves? All these hidden assumptions can take a programmer days to unravel.

Another audience for this document is military or support personnel charged with making existing DIS simulations work. They usually have good understanding of the military problem domain and perhaps the basics of networking and software installation, but the intersection of military simulation and virutal worlds is large, complex, and poorly documented. While often subject matter experts in the military aspects of the simulation, the nuts and bolts of how the simulation works are more obscure. They are not always able to work at a high level of abstraction and leave the details to the programmers. A basic understanding of how things are done in DIS is often a great help in communicating military requirements to programmers. 

Those working in HLA or TENA also can benefit from this document. The HLA Realtime Platform Reference Federation Object Model (RPR-FOM) uses many of the concepts from DIS, as does TENA. Understanding DIS concepts gets practioners well down the road to understanding HLA and TENA issues. 

Studying the standard in isolation can be confusing if the reader has no familiarity with the problems inherent to distributed simulations that DIS is trying to solve.  This document includes an overview of distributed simulations and the problems faced when implementing them. So background information on distributed simulations and virtual worlds is also included. If you already know all this, you can safely skip it. But for most programmers and administrators it provides the context for features or data that may seem mysterious at first. 

DIS consists of a few dozen standardized network messages exchanged between simulations. Understanding the syntax of these messages and how to create and receive them is the easy part of using DIS. A deeper understanding of what the semantic content of the messages are, and what problems they are trying to solve, is more difficult and more valuable.

If you just want to sling some code and skip all the throat-clearing, you can start reading the "Protocol Data Units: Exchanging State Information" section. DIS standardizes the format of network packets, and has no formal programming API. What matters is the format of packets on the wire; the implementation of the code that puts them into that format is up to the user. This means that if you compare implementations from two different DIS vendor libraries the code will look different. The examples in this document use the open-dis DIS project, available at https://github.org/open-dis. The open-dis project has DIS library implementations in Java, C++, Javascript, Python, C#, and Objective-C, along with sample applications. There are other implementations of DIS, both open source and commercial. There are also many home-grown implementations of the standard. This means that the code-slingers out there will see differences in the source code of two applications that do the same thing.

##History

DIS arose from a Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA) project in the 1980's called SIMNET. At the time TCP/IP and high speed networks were just getting their legs, computers were becoming powerful enough to do the compuation, and 3D graphics was in its infancy. Individual simulators of the era sometimes had displays that replicated a soldier's view of the battlefield, but they weren't networked with each other. Each simulator worked in isolation, and an aircraft simulator couldn't see a tank controlled by another simulator. The idea of SIMNET, quite advanced for the time, was to create a virtual, shared battlefield in which all participants on multiple computers could see and interact with each other. SIMNET's major advance--it was arguably the first large real-time distirubted virtual world--was to serve as a basis for the research that allowed this to happen. 

A screen capture from an early SIMNET application is shown below:

Each participant is in a simulator that controls one tank, and each tank views the shared virutal battlefield. All the vehicles interact in the same shared enviroment. If one simulator causes a tank to move, the other partipants see that tank move, in real time, in the shared environment. Networked first person shooter games like Call of Duty do this routinely today, but at the time the concept was revolutionary.

There are several parts to the concept: graphics, networking, and the semantics and format of the messages exchanged.

The graphics portion of the shared virutal world is a subject unto itself. There are many ways to draw the 3D images we see on the screen, from OpenGL and Direct3D to higher level scene graphs, such as OpenInventor or X3D. At a high level objects can be rendered with the aid of a 3D game engine such as Lumberyard or Unity. We will be essentially ignoring the graphical display portion of virtual worlds, and focus on what the network and the messages sent over it are doing. It's simply too large of a topic to cover in this context. 

Before the application could be implemented there needed to be a way to exchange *state information* between simulators. State information is data about one participant in the simulation. In the case of a tank, the state information may include its position, the direction it is facing, how fast it is moving, whether it is on fire, and which way the turret is pointing. It's this state information, and the format that it is exchanged in, that DIS standardizes. Once the state information is exchanged the graphics portion we just handwaved about above can be used to draw the scene the users see.

DARPA projects are intended to transition out of the incubator research phase and into useful implementations that add value to the military. SIMNET worked out many of the state information exchange issues involved in implementing a real-time networked virtual environment, but it needed to be implemented outside of the purview of DARPA. The group that would eventually become the Simulation Interoperability Standards Group (SISO) took over development of the network protocol portion of the project, renamed DIS, in a series of workshops held from 1989 to 1996. 

It is in the government's interest to have simulators interoperate with each other, and in particular to prevent vendor lock-in. If the protocol for exchanging state information is owned by a company that company can prevent simulator competitors from entering the market, or charge more to make their simulators interoperate with those from other companies. To be useful the DIS protocol had to be a *standard*. Simply providing a language implementation that did the job without also specifying what was being exchanged was inadequate. So SISO refined the SIMNET network protocol and developed a formal description of it, then took it to the IEEE, where it was approved as an international standard (IEEE-1278.1). From that point on anyone could buy the IEEE standard and write their own implementation. 

As is inevitable with these things, the standard has to be maintained and updated in light of experience and new technology. From the late 80's to about 1995 the DARPA SIMNET protocol was used. This predated the adoption of DIS as an IEEE standard. The first major release of a standard DIS was DIS version 5, in 1995. It was updated with  version 6, in 1998, when a few new network messages were added.  Version 7 was adopted in 2012, and maintained almost complete backwards compatiblity to the DIS version 5 of 1995, while at the same time adding a few new PDUs (network messages) related to directed energy weapons and also clarifying the semantics of protocol. SISO continues to support and update DIS in working groups, today in parallel with the HLA RPR-FOM, in a proposed DIS version 8. This version of DIS is may well break backwards compatiblity. 

## Terminology

There's a question of what to call applications like those described. Academics love to have arguments about terminology. "Virtual world" or "virtual environment" were  the early names for the class of application. A virtual world aims for a sense of immersion, and that requires high fidelity and responsive graphics. Developers can integrate other human senses into the virtual world application, such as haptics (touch), audio, or even smell to increase the feeling of presence.

Some of the early implementations ran on a single, large computer that had several graphical displays attached to it, while other implementations ran on multiple computers connected by a network.  "Networked Virtual Environment (NVE) is a more precise description of the applications as they are currently implemented.

First Person Shooter (FPS) games such as Call of Duty or Half Life are a subset of NVEs, as are military virtual environment trainers. Games use essentially the same technoloy as military training NVEs, and have to deal with the same implementation issues that we will discuss later. The primary difference between military simulation NVEs and games is the use to which the application will be put, not the technology. Military simulations are intended for training and analysis, while the games are written to entertain customers. Even if the technology is fundamentally the same, a game used in a military context can result in negative training for the users--for example, by making a user think that he will be invulnerable to rifle fire if he ducks behind a sheetrock wall. That behavior may make for an fun game, but it doesn't reflect reality.

The size of gaming/entertainment industry dwarfs that of the military simulation industry, and games are often more visually polished. A single top level title may cost hundreds of millions to develop and even more to market. The business models are different. The product life cycle of a game may be only a few years, while a military simulation may be in used for decades. A game developer is usually not interested in a standard network protocol. They consider vendor lock-in a feature, not a bug.

## Other Uses

While DIS was originally intended for virtual environments, the existence of a network protocol for exchanging state information was discovered to be useful in other ways. At its root, DIS describes the position of things in the world, and that capability can be used in applications other than NVEs. If we subtract the graphics part of the application we're left with a description of the dynamic state of a battlefield. We can use this information for a variety of purposes. 

Constructive simulations can control entities with Artificial Intelligence (AI), either simple or complex, and those entities can use DIS to publish their positions. Applications can use this to create brigade, division, or even corps-sized units that manuever on the computational battlefield. The position of the units can be visualized with 2D maps, which don't create much of a sense of presence, but that's beside the point. That's not what those simulations are aiming to create.

Less often, DIS can be used to describe the position of live entities--real people or vehicles in the real world. GPS receivers and mobile wireless devices are cheap and in everyone's pocket in cell phone form. Live participants can send their position in DIS format and this information can be ingested into existing simulations. Live participants can be elements of existing, standard simulations.

This can work in the other direction as well. Augmented reality is an emerging technology, and has received enormous investments from large technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. It's probable that augmented reality applications will receive updates from constructive simulations running on mobile devices.

DIS is frequently used as "glue" to enable applications that use HLA or TENA to talk to each other. HLA has some virtues, but interoperablity between HLA applications is a challenge. It's usually easier to get two HLA applications that use RPR-FOM variants to talk to each other using DIS than via directly via HLA.

## Parting Thoughts

Given the technology of the era, the developers of DIS were visionary. Even decades after it was developed and standardized it still holds up quite well. The research it prompted was trailblazing, and served as the starting point for many military simulations and entertainment industry game applications. The ideas worked out in DIS are still widely used today.
