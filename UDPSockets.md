##UDP Sockets

DIS doesn't hide TCP/IP socket level programming from users and it's up to the programmer to handle them. This is not all that difficult to do, but there are some historical issues that may confuse programmers, in particular on modern hosts with several network interfaces. It's not at all unusual for a developer's laptop to have a dozen network interfaces for all the virtual machines being run localy. 

###Broadcast
Many DIS simulation implementations use broadcast UDP sockets for scalability. This allows one datagram to be sent, and N other participating simulations on the same network to receive that single message. If designed today DIS would have instead adopted multicast for this purpose, but at the time DIS was designed multicast wasn't invented yet. As a result there's a installed base of DIS applications that use UDP broadcast on port 3000. There's nothing that prevents multicast from being used--it's a perfectly valid choice, and in fact preferred. But the reality of the installed base draws people to broadcast.

In the old days Unix workstations typically had two IPv4 network interfaces:  the loopback interface, lo0 or the like, that had an IP address of 127.0.0.1 associated with it, and an ethernet interface, often en0, that had a public IP address associated with it, such as 172.20.81.4. When you created a UDP socket it "bound" to both IPs via INADDR_ANY or the special IP 0.0.0.0, meaning it was associated with both the 127.0.0.1 and 172.20.81.4 IP addresses. The socket could *listen* for incoming messages on both IPs. When you *sent* a datagram to the special, reserved address "255.255.255.255" it would be sent on all IPs on which the host is bound. There's been inconsistent behavior on TCP/IP implementations, though. Often in practice one message would go out over one interface, as determined by the routing table of the host machine. This was the default IP address, very often the last interface brought up, usually en0. Because there was only one interface, it almost always worked. This is in fact probably the approach you should start out with: create a socket on INADDR_ANY, which binds it to all IPs; send to the broadcast address 255.255.255.255, which should send it out on the default IP address. This sometimes fails, though; some smart switch ports will disallow it for security reasons. It's better to explictly state the broadcast address to use.

On modern hosts there are often many interfaces: loopback, a wired interface, a wireless interface, several interfaces associated with VMs running on your host, etc. Each network interface can have several IPs associated with it, and each IP a different broadcast address. So the question of which IP the message goes out on is tricker, as is the broadcast address to use. Here's a listing of the interfaces on my MacOS laptop with one VMWare VM running:

There's the familiar loopback interface, lo0, plus the wireless interface en0, which has an IP of 172.20.144.41 associated with it. There's also an Apple interface for bluetooth at awdl0, an unused ethernet interface at en1, and some vmware interface at vmnet1 with IP 192.168.214.1, plus some other interfaces, some up and some down. The question is, if we send a broadcast datagram, on which interface will it be sent? 

The most direct way to solve this problem is to send to the broadcast address on the interface you want to use. For example, if I want to send to the wireless network, 172.20.144.41, I should use the broadcast address 172.20.159.255 that ifconfig shows for that IP. If I send to the destination address "255.255.255.255", odds are it will go to the "default" IP address, which can be dodgy in practice, and may be prevented by site-local security policies implemented on the local network switch.

Some example code that creates a broadcast UDP socket and sends a message:

~~~~
import java.net.*;
import edu.nps.moves.dis.*;

....
MulticastSocket socket = null;
String BROADCAST_ADDRESS = "172.20.159.255";
EntityStatePdu pdu = new EntityStatePdu();

try
{           
    socket = new MulticastSocket(DIS_DESTINATION_PORT);
    byte data[] = pdu.marshalWithDisAbsoluteTimestamp()
    DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, InetAddress.getByName(BROADCAST_ADDRESS), 3000);
    socket.send(packet);
}
catch(Exception e)
{
    System.out.println("Unable to initialize networking. Exiting.");
    System.out.println(e);
    System.exit(-1);
}
~~~~

This works; the host routing table will cause the packet to be sent out on the specified interface. It does create a configuration problem, in that you need to specify the broadcast address, and that will vary from network to network. If you can get away with it, using "255.255.255.255" as the broadcast address should send it out on the default interface, which is probably what you want, but the security nazis may stop this from happening.

You can get fancier here, and in Java walk the network interfaces, collecting the broadcast addresses at runtime:

~~~~
Set<InetAddress> bcastAddresses = new HashSet();

// Walk all the interfaces
Enumeration<NetworkInterface> interfaces = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces();

while(interfaces.hasMoreElements()
{
  NetworkInterface anInterface = interfaces.nextElement();
  
  if(anInterface.isLoopback())
    continue;
  
  // Each interface may have several IPv4 addresses. Walk each of those, 
  // determining the bcast address for each
  for(InterfaceAddress interfaceAddress : networkInterface.getInterfaceAddresses() )
  {
     InetAddress bcast = interfaceAddress.getBroadcast();
     if( bcast == null)
        continue;
     
     // Found one. Add it to our list of all bcast addresses.
     bcastAddresses.add(bcast);
  }  
}

// We come out of this with a Set that contains all the bcast addresses
~~~~

Once you have the set of valid broadcast addresses you can pick which one to use, or send out a message on all of them.

###Multicast

It's more modern to use multicast, which has near-universal support in operating systems these days. The only exceptions might be in some very constrained embedded operating systems. Multicast is the preferred solution if you don't need backward compatibility with existing broadcast DIS applications.

Example code:

~~~~
import java.net.*;
import edu.nps.moves.dis.*;

....
MulticastSocket socket = null;
String BROADCAST_ADDRESS = "172.20.159.255";
EntityStatePdu pdu = new EntityStatePdu();

try
{           
    socket = new MulticastSocket(DIS_DESTINATION_PORT);
    InetAddress multicastAddress = InetAddress.getByName("239.1.2.3");
    socket.join(multicastAddress);
    
    byte data[] = pdu.marshalWithDisAbsoluteTimestamp()
    DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, multicastAddress, 3000);
    socket.send(packet);
}
catch(Exception e)
{
    System.out.println("Unable to initialize networking. Exiting.");
    System.out.println(e);
    System.exit(-1);
}

~~~~

This uses the "scoped multicast range", which should keep traffic site-local.
